Arpg
====


Arpg is an addon for Garry's Mod with multiple compatible 'plugins' or 'componants' availible for install.
The componants can range from Rpg plugins, to Shiny HUD additions, to an inventory system.


Due to the endless possibilities of having such a system; Arpg is always a Work in Progress.
